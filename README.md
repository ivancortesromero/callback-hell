# callback-hell
callback-hell is a repository that demonstrates the problem of callback hell in JavaScript, and provides examples of how to avoid it.

## What is callback hell?
Callback hell is a term used to describe the situation when the code that relies heavily on callbacks becomes unreadable and difficult to maintain. This often occurs when dealing with asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

## How does this repository help?
This repository provides examples of callback hell in JavaScript and demonstrates how to avoid it by using various techniques such as Promises and async/await. The examples are organized in a way that makes it easy to compare the code that uses callbacks with the code that uses the alternative techniques.

## How to use this repository?
This repository can be used as a reference to learn about callback hell and how to avoid it. You can clone this repository and run the examples to see the difference between the code that uses callbacks and the code that uses Promises or async/await.
